## Description

In this project we had to refactor a fully functioning Google Books API built with a RESTful API and change it to a GraphQL API built with the Apollo Server. The App has originally been built with the MERN Stack React, MongoDB Nodejs and Expressjs.

1.  it has now been set up with an Apollo Server and uses GraphQL queries and mutations.
  
2.  modified authentication middleware to work with the context of a GraphQL API.
 
3.  Created an Apollo Provider to communicate to the Apollo Server.
 
4.  setup on MongoDB Atlas
 
5.  all works locally!

Unsuccessful

1.  i was unable to set it up properly on Heroku seems to be a problem at the moment communicating with Github. will look to try again at a later date.


## Installation

1. Clone or download the zip file to your computer.
2. In your code editor open a terminal and ensure you are in the root folder and run Npm Install to install all the   dependebncies in server and client folder.
3. run npm start and the book search will open in the browser.


##  Usage

You can sign up and log in from the navigation bar as well as utilise the search area for a books of your choosing.
